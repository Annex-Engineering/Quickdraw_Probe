# Magnetic Microswitch Probe
used to replace the omron inductive sensor with a microswitch, this is a manual process, but allows you to easily and cheaply probe the bed surface (or replace a dead probe temporarily) for about a dollar in parts.

this is built in 2 parts, the circuit completes by wedging the wire between the magnets. See edrawing for more information
The upper portion can stay on the printer

Dont forget to set your horizontal Z move higher, or you will crash, and dont scrub your nozzle with the switch installed

Youll Need:
- 8x: 6x3 cylinder magnets
- Some ABS
- Some Wire
- Your Brain
