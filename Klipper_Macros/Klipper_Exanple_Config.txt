Here is an example config to use as a starting point, with the dockable probe module

# Dockable Probe
[dockable_probe]
pin: #your probe pin goes here
x_offset: 0 # offset for microswitch x direction off nozzle
y_offset: 0 # offset for microswitch y direction off nozzle
z_offset: 0 # offset for microswitch in z height
samples: 3
sample_retract_dist: 15 # this is so the machine has time for the switch to reset properly, especially with a higher retract speed
samples_result: median
samples_tolerance: 0.04
samples_tolerance_retries: 3
speed: 5 # do not go higher than 10mm/s, you will destroy the switch
lift_speed: 20

# dockable probe specific
dock_position:             6,362, 5 #you need to set these on your own
safe_z_position:           175,175 #used the center of the bed for this
approach_position:		   6,322, 5 #you need to set these on your own
detach_position:		   20, 362 #you need to set these on your own
attach_speed:              20
detach_speed:              100
travel_speed:              300
check_open_attach:         True #checks to see if the probe is attached before moving the toolhead, if not retries to pick up the probe
dock_fixed_z:              True # k series printers use a dock fixed in the z axis, this was off a K2
dock_retries:			   2
