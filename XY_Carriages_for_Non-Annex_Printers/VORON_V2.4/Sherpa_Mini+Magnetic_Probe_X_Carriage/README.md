## Sherpa Mini Toolhead for the V2.4 3D printer

![picture](Images/1.PNG)


## What is it?
This toolhead allows mounting for a lightweight and powerfull Sherpa Mini extruder on a V2.4. It comes with support for a magprobe instead of the inductive probe. The total weight has been reduced too. A bigger rear exhaust has also been realized for the hotend cooling fan. All toolheads such as the Dragon/Mosquito/V6 are supported. All microswitch, halleffect, IGUS and Generic cable chain options are supported too. No buildvolume is lost since the probe can be docked in the 10mm y overtravel of the V2.4.

This new probe is completely solderless and has many benefits such as actually probing the surface of the buildplate and great repeatability. The dock can be mounted stationary or onto the gantry (See the experimental folder).
