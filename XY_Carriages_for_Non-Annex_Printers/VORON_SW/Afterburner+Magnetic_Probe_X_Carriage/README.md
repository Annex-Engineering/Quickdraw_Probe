# Magprobe for Switchwire MGN12H

The magprobe replaces the inductive probe. This new probe is able to probe any surfacetype and isnt affected by magnets. 
Secondly its able to function as z endstop. No changing of the z offset anymore when swapping buidplates of different thickness.

You will need to configure your switchwire to do an intial z home before probe pickup from the dock. Few ways of doing this is mounting a z max endstop or a special z min endstop.
