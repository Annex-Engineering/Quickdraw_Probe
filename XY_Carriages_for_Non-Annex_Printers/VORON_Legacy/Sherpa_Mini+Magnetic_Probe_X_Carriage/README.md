## Sherpa Mini Toolhead for the Voron Legacy 3D printer with magprobe

![picture](Images/5.PNG)

## What is it?
This toolhead allows mounting for a lightweight and powerfull Sherpa Mini extruder. It comes with support for a magprobe instead of the inductive probe. This allows for better packaging and the nozzle to be closer to the rods then the original toolhead. The weight has been reduced too. A bigger rear exhaust has also been realized for the hotend cooling fan. All toolheads such as the Dragon/Mosquito/V6 are supported. Additionally the toolhead has a build in cable clamp for the umbilical inspired by discord user Edwardyeeks. This new probe is completely solderless and has many benefits such as actually probing the surface of the buildplate and great repeatability.
